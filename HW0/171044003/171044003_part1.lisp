(setq numList nil) ; I keep the numbers

   First of all, I am evaluating whether the character I read is number, space, "(" and ")".
   In this case, I put the character I read directly to the numlist.
   If the character I read is digit, I convert the number from ascii value to number value and push it to digitList.
   If the character I read is a space and the digitlist is not nil, so if I put a number in the digitlist before;
   I combine the characters and convert them to numbers and put them in the numList.
   Then I make the digitlist nil in case you can create a new number.
   When all the conditions are over, if the digitlist is still full, I convert it to a number and put it in numList.
   Thus, the reading process ends.
